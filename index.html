        <p>This is the web page of Erico Alexander Odelius Teixeira, I was born on december 24 1979, on the eve of chrismas, my mother was planning on eating a shrimp dinner. However I was under way, and stopped her from having it.</p>
        <p>Sao Paulo is the biggest city in South America, home to 16 milion people. I lived there until I was 16, when my step father was invited to work for the govenment, and I had to move to Brasilia. Brasilia is the capital of the country, </p>
        <p>and a quiet town. At first I did live there for a short period of time, for I enroled on a exchange program and went to live in Kingston, NY - USA. It was a very pleasant exchange, I met wonderful people in Kingston.</p>
        <p>After my exchange program was over, I moved to Berlin, Germany. I lived in Berlin with my father, who was working there for a big multinational firm. After Berlin I moved to Paris, to study Business Administration at the American University of Paris</p>
		<p>I was not succeed in my degree, and moved to Sao Paulo. I then moved to Brasilia in 2007 and lived there until 2015. Now I live in Londrina Parana- Brasil.</p>
